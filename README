# ðŸ“Š IBEX 35 Stock Price Prediction - LSTM Model Report

## **1. Data Preprocessing **
### **1.1 Data Source & Features**
- **Dataset:** IBEX 35 historical stock prices from **Yahoo Finance**.
- **Time Period:** 2016-01-01 to 2024-01-01.
- **Selected Features:**
  - `Close`: Used as the target variable for prediction.
  - `Date`: Used for time-series indexing.

### **1.2 Preprocessing Steps**
- **Missing Values Handling:** Checked for and removed missing values.
- **Date Handling:** Converted timestamps to a uniform format and ensured compatibility.
- **Feature Scaling:** Applied **Min-Max Scaling** (range: 0 to 1) for better LSTM performance.
- **Train-Test Split:** 
  - **Training Data:** Before 2023-01-01 (~80% of dataset).
  - **Testing Data:** From 2023-01-01 onwards (~20% of dataset).

## **2. Feature Engineering**
We included additional technical indicators to improve predictive power:

### **2.1 Technical Indicators**
| Indicator | Explanation | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** | Measures stock momentum (overbought/oversold conditions). | Helps capture trends. |
| **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** | Identifies trend direction and strength. | Useful for trend-following strategies. |
| **Bollinger Bands** | Defines volatility levels based on standard deviations. | Helps detect price reversals. |

### **2.2 Why These Features?**
- **These indicators help identify trends, momentum, and volatility**, which are critical for making accurate predictions in stock prices.

## **3. Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning**
### **3.1 Why LSTM?**
- **LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory)** are well-suited for **sequential time-series data**.
- They capture **long-term dependencies** and patterns in stock price movement.

### **3.2 Model Architecture**
| Layer Type | Units | Activation | Additional Notes |
|------------|-------|------------|-----------------|
| **LSTM** | 50 | tanh | Learns sequential dependencies |
| **Dropout** | 0.2 | - | Prevents overfitting |
| **LSTM** | 50 | tanh | Second layer for deeper learning |
| **Dropout** | 0.2 | - | Regularization |
| **Dense** | 25 | relu | Fully connected layer |
| **Dense** | 1 | linear | Final output (closing price) |

### **3.3 Hyperparameters**
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Lookback Window (Past Days Used)** | 20 |
| **Epochs** | 50 |
| **Batch Size** | 10 |
| **Optimizer** | Adam |
| **Loss Function** | Mean Squared Error (MSE) |

## **4. Model Evaluation and Results**
### **4.1 Performance Metrics**
We used three evaluation metrics:

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** | 18.05 | Lower is better (prediction error in original units) |
| **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** | 2.31% | Lower % means better accuracy |
| **RÂ² Score** | 0.92 | Closer to 1 means better fit |

### **4.2 Visual Analysis**
#### **ðŸ”¹ Actual vs Predicted Close Prices**
- The model successfully captures the **overall trend** of IBEX 35 stock prices.
- Some **minor deviations** exist due to sudden market fluctuations.

#### **ðŸ”¹ Error Distribution**
- Errors are **normally distributed around 0**, indicating **no major bias in predictions**.
